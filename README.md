The Optical Bloch Equations give the time evolution of a two-state quantum system interacting with monochromatic electromagnetic radiation (in a system where there is some form of decay). The equations give the time evolution of a quantity called the Bloch Vector, which fully specifies the density matrix of the system. 

My code solves the Optical Bloch Equations for a given set of parameters, initial conditions and range of time values (using the solve_ivp function from the scripy.integrate library) and plots the results on an animated 3D Bloch Sphere (using the QuTiP library)
